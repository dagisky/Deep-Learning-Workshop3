# DeepLearningWorkshop3
**Under Construction**
This Marks the 3rd deep learning and AI workshop in UESTC. The codes cover the key ideas involved in deep learing. We shall see how basic and some advanced machine learing algorithms are implemted. we will also case study some of the latest deeplearing algoritms. All codes are implemented in Python. 

## Installation
Most of the codes avalable here need python and pytoch.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
